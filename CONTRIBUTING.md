## Edit Blog (Detailed Guide)

To add a new blog post, create a markdown file in `./content/blog/`. The header of the blog post must contain this YAML metadata block:

    ~~~
    title: "Blog post title"
    description: "Short excerpt or summary about the blog post. (usually 1 sentence)"
    date: "2017-01-01"
    author: "Your Name"
    categories:
        - "one"
        - "two"
        - "three"
    ~~~

(Categories are not implemented yet.)

Then, write the blog post in Markdown. Do not include the post title in the body of the post, it'll be an `<h1>` generated by the YAML metadata.


### Build for Production
Please run the following command to build all documentation.

    yarn run blog


## Edit Documentation (Detailed Guide)

### New Documentation Page
To add a new page, create a markdown file in `./content/docs/` or `./content/intro/`. The title of the page is based on its filename. For example, 'this-is-awesome.md' will have a title of 'This is Awesome'.

By default, pages are ordered alphabetically based on filename. If you want to have a custom order for your documentation, label the files with numbers. Like this:

    â–¾ try-this/
        #01-blah-blah.md
        #02-bob-lob-law-app.md
        #03-blargh.md
        #04-balhooney.md

### New Documentation Section
To add a new section to documentation, add a new directory under `.content/docs/`.

### Build for Production
Please run the following command to build all documentation.

    yarn run docs

## Editing Tips

### Include Images

To include an image in a blog post or documentation page, place the image in the `./src/assets/images/` directory. Link to the image in the following format:

    <img alt="Application Architecture" src="../assets/images/tm-app-example.png">

The `../assets/images/` portion of the imgsrc is immutable because all markdown posts are built into Vue components located in `./src/content/`

### Link to the Site
If you want to link to other pages in the Tendermint site, please use the full path. This will prevent the user's browser from reloading the entire website. For example:

    # won't work
    [block hash](./tendermint-types#block-hash)

    # will work
    [block hash](/docs/internals/tendermint-types#block-hash)

### Link to Headings (e.g. `<h1><h2><h3>`)
HTML IDs are automatically generated for headings. You can link to them, but please remember to use the slug case format. 'this-is-slug-case'

    # won't work
    [block hash](./tendermint-types#Block.Hash)

    # will work
    [block hash](/docs/internals/tendermint-types#block-hash)
