<p>By now you&#x2019;ve seen how to run a simple example ABCI application on a local Tendermint node
and on a remote Tendermint cluster.</p>
<p>To learn more about building ABCI applications and integrating with Tendermint, see the <router-link to=/docs/guides/app-development>Developer Guides</router-link>.
To learn more about running the Tendermint software, see the <router-link to=/docs/guides/using-tendermint>Using Tendermint Guide</router-link>.</p>

There is also the <router-link to=/static/docs/tendermint.pdf>original whitepaper</router-link>, though it is now quite outdated.</p>
<p>The Tendermint <router-link to=/ecosystem>Software Ecosystem</router-link> contains many example applications and related software built by the Tendermint team and others. Check it out for some inspiration!</p>
<p>For details on how the software has changed, and what changes are in store, see the <router-link to=/docs/changelog>Changelog</router-link> and the <router-link to=/docs/roadmap>Roadmap</router-link>.</p>
