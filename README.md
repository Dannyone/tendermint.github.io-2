## Documentation Editing (Detailed Guide)

### Creating a New Page
To add a new page, create a markdown file in `./content/docs/` or `./content/intro/`. The title of the page is based on its filename. For example, 'this-is-awesome.md' will have a title of 'This is Awesome'.

By default, pages are ordered alphabetically based on filename. If you want to have a custom order for your documentation, label the files with numbers. Like this:

    â–¾ try-this/
        #01-blah-blah.md
        #02-bob-lob-law-app.md
        #03-blargh.md
        #04-balhooney.md

### Creating a New Section
To add a new section to documentation, add a new directory under `.content/docs/`.

### Markdown Links
If you want to link to other pages in the Tendermint site, please use the full path. This will prevent the user's browser from reloading the entire website. For example:

    # won't work
    [block hash](./tendermint-types#block-hash)

    # will work
    [block hash](/docs/internals/tendermint-types#block-hash)

### Markdown Link to Hash
HTML IDs are automatically generated for headings. You can link to them, but please remember to use the slug case format. 'this-is-slug-case'

    # won't work
    [block hash](./tendermint-types#Block.Hash)

    # will work
    [block hash](/docs/internals/tendermint-types#block-hash)

### Building for Production

Please run the following command to build all documentation.

    npm run docs
